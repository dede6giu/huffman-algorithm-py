# huffman-algorithm-py
> Huffman Algorithm built on python

# Notes

This program was built on python 3.12.

The program works as expected, transforming text into a "compressed" state. However, due to the nature the files are stored (`.txt` format), they are not actually smaller. The algorythm still works, and does its intended purpose.

# How to use

## Compression

1. Add the text that will be compressed inside the `/files/decompressed.txt` file.
2. Run `main.py` and choose option `0`
3. The resulting compression will be inside `/files/compressed.txt`.

## Decompression

1. Add the text that will be decompressed inside the `/files/compressed.txt` file.
2. Run `main.py` and choose option `1`
3. The resulting decompression will be inside `/files/decompressed.txt`.
